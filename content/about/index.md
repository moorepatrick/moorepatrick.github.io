# About Me

## Professionally
I'm a backend software engineer focused on processing pipelines, data engineering and analysis tools. I really enjoy writing in Go, but Python is where the data scientists are at.

## Unprofessionally
I'm a tinkerer of all sorts from bikes and locks, to pens and radios.
